MonkeyLogic_experiments
=======================

Basic files to run behavioral experiments with MonkeyLogic, as well as some routines for analyzing MonkeyLogic data files. This is work in progress, so be careful when using! It should serve as example to show how I approach these tasks, but since it also requires ongoing adjustments of task parameters it is nothing that is supposed to work out of the box.

get_joystick
------------

This paradigm should be used to acustom the NHP to use a analogue joystick as response device. Various parameters for trial timings and reward options should keep this timing file flexible enough to be used for several initial stages of the training.


change_release
--------------

This task is a variant of the previous one with the main difference that the animal only gives a short response after stimulus change. Otherwise, the joystick should not be pressed at all.
