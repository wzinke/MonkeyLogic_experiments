Get Joystisck
=======================

This timing file (get_joystick.m) is used for the initial training to use an analogue joystick as response device. The animal should learn, to pull the joystick when a square is shown on the screen, and release it as response to a contrast change of this square.

The resulting *.bhv file could be converted into an ascii trial table with the BHV2trialtable.m file. However, the timing file itself already creates a summary trial table in plain text format. Both data files coul dbe used for consistency checks.
